<h2 id="what-is-agrest"><a class="anchor" href="#what-is-agrest"></a>1. What is Agrest</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Agrest is a set of tools to build web APIs for your data. You would use it to expose a data store
(such as a relational database) as a RESTful web service. To achieve that
goal Agrest defines a simple HTTP/JSON-based protocol
(described in <a href="/protocol">Agrest Protocol</a>) and a server-side framework (described in <a href="/framework">Agrest Framework</a>).
The protocol ensures that any client, be it JavaScript, a mobile
app or maybe a server-side app, can make sense of any Agrest-enabled service. The
framework is written in Java and helps you to build services adhering to the
protocol.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Agrest is open source and is distributed under the terms of
<a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/agrestio/agrest/master/LICENSE.txt">Apache 2.0 license</a></p>

<h2 id="what-agrest-is-not"><a class="anchor" href="#what-agrest-is-not"></a>2. What Agrest is Not</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Agrest is not an automated engine to take your DB online with a single command.
You still have to write code for JAX-RS endpoints (however simple and trivial that code might end up being).
Having this code around allows you to customize processing, implement security around endpoints, hide certain methods, etc.
This is a defensive approach that goes a long way to avoid unintended consequences when opening up your data on the web.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Having said that, such an engine can be written on top of Agrest with relative ease.</p>

<h2 id="supported-data-stores"><a class="anchor" href="#supported-data-stores"></a>3. Supported Data Stores</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Agrest is written on top of <a href="http://cayenne.apache.org">Apache Cayenne ORM</a>
and supports any relational data store, such as MySQL or Oracle.
Support for alternative data stores can be provided with relative ease. E.g. NoSQL
databases, flat files, etc. E.g. we&#8217;ve written POJO and LDAP backends.</p>

<h2 id="security"><a class="anchor" href="#security"></a>4. Security</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>From the very beginning Agrest was designed with security in mind. It can be easily
integrated with common web and enterprise security solutions
(OAuth, <a href="http://shiro.apache.org/">Apache Shiro</a>, Spring Security, etc.),
giving Java developers a straightforward API to implement custom object and attribute-level access.</p>
